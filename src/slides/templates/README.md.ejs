# Slides

This folder contains some slides' source code.

## Requirements

If you are using Docker, `docker-compose` is the only dependency needed.

If you plan on running the project without Docker, you will need
the following softwares installed:

- `make`
- `pandoc`
- `pandoc-crossref`
- `fswatch`

## Edit the slides

If you are using Docker, juste run `make up` to start the stack.

Without Docker, run `make watch`.

You can then edit the slides and access their HTML export in the `build` directory.

You can also edit the `metadata.yaml` file following your use case.
More information about this metadata file can be found on
[pandoc's `yaml_metadata_block`'s documentation](https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#extension-yaml_metadata_block).
