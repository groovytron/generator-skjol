# Diagrams

This folder contains some diagrams' source code.

## Requirements

If you are using Docker, `docker-compose` is the only dependency needed.

If you plan on running the project without Docker, you will need
the following softwares installed:

- `make`
- `curl`
- `sed`
- `inotify-tools`
- a working and accessible instance of [kroki](https://kroki.io)
(<https://kroki.io> is publicly available if you have no private instance and
sending your diagrams through the wire is not an issue)

## Edit and create diagrams

If you are using Docker, juste run `make up` to start the stack.

Without Docker, set the Makefile's variable `KROKI_HOST_URL` to point to
your kroki instance and run `make watch`.

You can then edit the diagrams in the `diagrams` folder and access their SVG
export in the `build` directory.
